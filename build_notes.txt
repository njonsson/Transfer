CMake command, run any time we update file list
cmake -S . -B build -DSDL3_DIR=C:/Users/marco/Projects/SDL3/cmake

// For macos run without the -DSLD3 portion of the above command

run after the first command to build the application.
cmake --build build --config Debug

This creates the executable file in cwd/build/Debug .exe

The cmake also automatically copies the x64 SDL3.dll into the dir next to the executable

Note that the build dir is for the cmake built version of the game, and the innards of Transfer contain the .sln which is the convenient MSVS version
