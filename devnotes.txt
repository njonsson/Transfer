All fully capitalized methods are top level 'master' priority. Other camel case methods are lower level utility type functions.


Need to find a way to add rendering on click with velocity line as well

rewrite line to be an arrow, maybe build custom svg?

On pause, maybe display all the internally stored velocity arrows? write function to take arbitrary body and draw the arrow rather than storing all the contents of the thing in a nested struct which is nasty


TBI will stand for To be implemented.


add custom prints for physics structures

test black/white holes. Should they inherit from grav body?


Make scrolling functionality. Should allow smooth panning. Also a play pause to the physics. 

Add animation for instantiation. Investigate bloom on stars? add grav body texture, small enough masses should be terrestrial, larges masses should be more beefy.


Eventually refactor memory management to use smart pointers. It will vastly improve the readability of the code.


Add different types of instantiations -- black holes, dust, gas, planets, and stars.
